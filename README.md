## Important Notice

The `master` branch contains the latest unstable development code. If you are running a server then you probably want to use a v4 release for now. You can obtain this from [the releases page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/latest) or by running `git checkout $(git describe --abbrev=0 --tags insp4)` if you are installing from Git.

## About

InspIRCd is a modular C++ Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server for UNIX-like and Windows systems.

## Supported Platforms

InspIRCd is supported on the following platforms:

- Most recent BSD variants using the Clang 10+ or GCC 10+ compilers and the GNU toolchains (Make, etc).

- Most recent Linux distributions using the Clang 10+ or GCC 10+ compilers and the GNU toolchain.

- The most recent three major releases of macOS using the AppleClang 12, Clang 10+, or GCC 10+ compilers and the GNU toolchain.

- Windows 10 build 17061 or newer using the MSVC 19.29+ (Visual Studio 16.10 2019) compiler and CMake 3.20 or newer.

Other platforms and toolchains may also work but are not officially supported by the InspIRCd team. Generally speaking if you are using a reasonably modern UNIX-like system you should be able to build InspIRCd on it. If you can not and you wish to submit a patch we are happy to accept it as long as it is not extremely large.

If you encounter any bugs then [please file an issue](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/issues/new/choose).

## Installation

Most InspIRCd users running a UNIX-like system build from source. A guide about how to do this is available on [the InspIRCd docs site](https://docs.inspircd.org/4/installation/source).

Building from source on Windows is generally not recommended but [a guide is available](https://docs.inspircd.org/4/installation/windows-source/) if you wish to do this.

If you are running on Debian 12/13, RHEL 8/9, Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, or Windows 10+ binary packages are available from [the downloads page](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd/releases/latest).

<!--
TODO: uncomment this once we have a Docker container for v4.

A [Docker](https://www.docker.com) image is also available. See [the inspircd-docker repository](https://github.com/inspircd/inspircd-docker) for more information.

Some distributions ship an InspIRCd package in their package managers. We generally do not recommend the use of such packages as in the past distributions have made broken modifications to InspIRCd and not kept their packages up to date with essential security updates.
